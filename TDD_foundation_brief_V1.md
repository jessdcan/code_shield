# 5-Day Testing Bootcamp for Spring Boot Developers

## Overview
This intensive week-long bootcamp is designed for fresh graduates with Java and Spring Boot experience to master testing practices, TDD methodology, and automation testing tools used in production environments.

## Sample Project: "Task Management API"
A Spring Boot application that provides REST APIs for managing tasks with user authentication, featuring:
- Task CRUD operations
- User management
- Task assignment and status tracking
- Database persistence (PostgreSQL)
- Redis caching for performance
- Input validation and error handling

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this bootcamp, developers will:
- Master TDD red-green-refactor cycle
- Write effective unit tests achieving 80%+ coverage
- Implement integration tests for Spring Boot applications
- Test REST APIs thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test database interactions and caching layers
- Apply testing best practices and patterns

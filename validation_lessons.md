# Validation and Error Handling Lessons Learned

## 1. Validation Layer Conflict
- **Issue**: We had two competing validation mechanisms:
  - Bean validation using `@Valid` and `@NotBlank`/`@NotNull` annotations
  - Custom validation in `TaskValidator`
- **Problem**: The bean validation was intercepting requests before our custom validation could run, leading to different error responses than expected
- **Solution**: We removed the `@Valid` annotation from the controller methods to ensure our custom validation was used consistently
- **Lesson**: Be careful when mixing different validation approaches. Choose one approach and stick to it for consistency.

## 2. Exception Handling Structure
- **Issue**: The error response structure wasn't consistent between different types of validation errors
- **Problem**: Bean validation was returning field-specific errors, while our custom validation was returning a single error message
- **Solution**: We standardized on a single error response format through `GlobalExceptionHandler`:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "...",
    "status": 400,
    "errors": {
      "message": "Error message here"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Lesson**: Maintain consistent error response structures across your API. This makes it easier for clients to handle errors.

## 3. Validation Flow
- **Issue**: The validation flow wasn't clear - where should validation happen?
- **Problem**: Validation could happen at multiple layers (controller, service, entity)
- **Solution**: We established a clear validation flow:
  1. Controller receives request
  2. Service layer calls `TaskValidator`
  3. `TaskValidator` throws `IllegalArgumentException` for validation failures
  4. `GlobalExceptionHandler` catches and formats the error response
- **Lesson**: Have a clear, consistent validation strategy and document it for your team.

## 4. Test Coverage
- **Issue**: Tests were failing because they expected specific error messages
- **Problem**: The error messages weren't being properly propagated through the exception handling chain
- **Solution**: We ensured that:
  - `TaskValidator` throws exceptions with clear messages
  - `GlobalExceptionHandler` properly formats these messages
  - Tests verify both the status code and error message
- **Lesson**: Write tests that verify both the happy path and error scenarios, including the exact error messages.

## 5. Debugging Approach
- **Issue**: It was difficult to track where validation was failing
- **Solution**: We added debug logging in `TaskValidator` to track validation failures
- **Lesson**: Add appropriate logging to help diagnose issues in production and during development.

## 6. Code Organization
- **Issue**: Validation logic was scattered across different layers
- **Solution**: We centralized validation in `TaskValidator` and error handling in `GlobalExceptionHandler`
- **Lesson**: Keep related functionality together and follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
